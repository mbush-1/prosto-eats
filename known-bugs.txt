[NAVBAR] Logo anchor tag:
 - The anchor tag which holds the logo extends beyond the displayed (calculated) size of the image itself (seemingly because the anchor size corresponds with the initial image size rather than the new percent one).


things that can be done better:
 - in multiple page interfaces, use a script to load the headers (and footers).
 - recipe loader structure that adapts to each file can be tweaked for less checks.
